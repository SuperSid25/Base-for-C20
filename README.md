Covid 19 :
A boy running away from Covid 19 to keep himself protected. He comes in contact with vaccines and masks, which give him an extra life. Each person starts off with 3 lives, however they can increase that by getting vaccines and masks. Each time they come in contact Covid, a life gets deducted and once all lives are over, it is simply game over.
